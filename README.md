# FRAG Event Registration Timelines

### To maintain VRS eligibility, we provide team registration timestamps for all of our tournaments.

When registering to play at a FRAG event, teams purchase a ticket through our Square shop. These tickets are on a first come, first served system. Since the team ticket purchase comes from a private system, all of the entries in this repo are done manually.

The timestamps you see come directly from our Square dashboard, coinciding with the time that the transaction was completed.
